```
(define (new-if predicate then-clause else-clause)
    (cond (predicate then-clause)
          (else else-clause)))
```

- It will throw exception: aborting! maximum recursion depth exceeded

- If clause is a speical form, then-clause will be executed when predicate clause is true, else-clause will not be executed.

- However, new-if is a function. Bother then-clause and else-clause will be executed no matter what predicate value is.

- The root reason is the expression evaluation order for the application of evaluation sequence. before evaluate new-if, it requires to evaluate its parameter first. So need evaluate else clause. Because of recursion definition, new round of evalute new-if happends while evaluate sqrt-iter. Never ends.
